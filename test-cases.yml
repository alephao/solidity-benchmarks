tests:
  # Transfer
  # - For transfer tests, there is one account with tokens from 1 to 100.
  # - The numbers below is which token ID to transfer. Each number in the 
  #   array will generate a test transfering the specific token Id. This only 
  #   affects a few implementations like ERC721A.
  transfer: [1, 10, 50, 100]

  # Approve
  # - same logic as Transfer, but for approval, the numbers below are token ids
  approve: [1, 10, 50, 100]

  # Mint
  # - The numbers below are the amount to mint. Each number in the array will
  #   generate a test mining the number.
  mint: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 50, 100]
