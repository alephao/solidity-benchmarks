    methods:
      # Transfer
      # - For transfer tests, there is one account with tokens from 1 to 100.
      # - The numbers below is which token ID to transfer. Each number in the
      #   array will generate a test transfering the specific token Id. This only
      #   affects a few implementations like ERC721A.
      transfer: [1, 10, 50, 100]
      # Approve
      # - same logic as Transfer, but for approval, the numbers below are token ids
      approve: [1, 10, 50, 100]
      # Burn
      # - same logic as Transfer, but for burn, the numbers below are token ids
      burn: [1, 10, 50, 100]

      # Mint
      # - The numbers below are the amount to mint. Each number in the array will
      #   generate a test minting the number.
      mint: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 50, 100]

      # ERC2309Mint
      # - The numbers below are the amount to mint using ERC2309 during constructor.
      # - Only apply to ERC2309Variations
      # - Same logic as Mint for each amount.
      ERC2309Mint: [5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300]
